# android-crond

Simple Android app which implements crond using AlarmManager.

Works best with root.

Without root, commands can be run but they run from a very limited context so there isn't much
that they can do.

You need to edit the crontab with another app.

Binaries can be obtained using the F-Droid client, from my custom repository:
