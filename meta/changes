* Re-add the job running service and scheduling changes, since battery optimization is what actually
  fixed the scheduling issues I had.

v1.3 (1016)

* Work correctly when the crond process is launched to handle the alarm.

v1.3 (1015)

* Revert the job running service and scheduling changes, since battery optimization is what actually
  fixed the scheduling issues I had.
* Target Android 13 and update dependencies to current versions.
* Force kill the app if root is granted while the app is running, so things can re-load properly.

v1.3 (1014)

* Notify the user about a lack of root (but only once).
* Prompt the user to disable battery optimization, since it keeps ruining the app for me.

v1.3 (1013)

* Schedule the next job before running the current job. Attempted workaround for Android 8+ ignoring
  scheduled alarms.
