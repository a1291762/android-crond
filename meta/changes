* Target Android 14 (API 34).
* Disable the ability to work without root because it was not very useful and broke jobs scheduled
after boot complete (unless the app was opened and crond stopped and started).

v1.3 (1018)

* Stop requesting background optimization disabled, since the job running service means this isn't
  needed anymore.

v1.3 (1017)

* Re-add the job running service, since it ensures the app is not prevented from
  responding to alarm events after several days. Forcing the app to not be optimized
  also works, but this seems better.

v1.3 (1016)

* Work correctly when the crond process is launched to handle the alarm.

v1.3 (1015)

* Revert the job running service and scheduling changes, since battery optimization is what actually
  fixed the scheduling issues I had.
* Target Android 13 and update dependencies to current versions.
* Force kill the app if root is granted while the app is running, so things can re-load properly.

v1.3 (1014)

* Notify the user about a lack of root (but only once).
* Prompt the user to disable battery optimization, since it keeps ruining the app for me.

v1.3 (1013)

* Schedule the next job before running the current job. Attempted workaround for Android 8+ ignoring
  scheduled alarms.
